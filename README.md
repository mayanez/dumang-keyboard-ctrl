*NOTE:* For correct functionality under Linux, you need to copy the udev file provided in this repo into the appropriate directory for you distro. You might then need to call `udevadm control --reload-rules` to reload the rules.

Should you run into any problems please open an `Issue`. Hopefully I can help ðŸ˜¸
